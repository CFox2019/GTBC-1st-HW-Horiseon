# GTBC-1st-HW-Horiseon

# Purpose

The purpose of this assignment was to refactor the website to follow accessibility standards and to make it more readable.

# What I learned in this assignment

It is important to use semantic elements to make the site more readable and accessible.

It is important for the elements to follow a logical structure, not only with styling but also with the HTML elements.

You should always use alt attributes with images because it helps those with disabilities and makes the site more readable.
